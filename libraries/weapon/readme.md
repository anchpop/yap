# Weapon - A cross-device sync engine 

Note: this repo is in the very early stages and should not really be used by anyone other than me

## Concept

You're writing a webapp. There are a number of desirable qualities you'd like it to have.

1. Users should be able to use your app without logging in
2. When they do log in, their data should "magically" be transferred to their account and saved to the cloud
3. Any further changes they make in your app should of course be saved to the cloud as well
4. And be synced to all their devices (instantly)
5. And of course, they should be able to use your app offline

Well, then weapon is the crate for you! (once i finish it)
